                        There is a mode of [Profile for creating DVDs-NTSC (640x480) ] in the profile <BR>
                        for saving PS3. <BR>
                        A wonderful story is able to be enjoyed on the TV screen <BR>
                        if saving the work in this mode and converting it into DVD-Video... I thought so. <BR>
                        This was failure in my environment. <BR>
                        When the output WMV file is played on the media player directly, <BR>
                        it is out of focus fairly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb10">
                        I thought that the WMV file is in focus on TV if converting it into DVD-Video <BR>
                        and saving onto DVD disk. However, it was out of focus after all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Oppositely, converting the WMV file output by the default profile [Profile for computers-2 (640x480) ] into DVD-Video <BR>
                        becomes a far clearer image. <BR>
                        There might be a problem in my operating method about this phenomenon. <BR>
                        However, this phenomenon is a mystery for me.

                        The number of photos that can be treated by PS3 is up to 300. <BR>
                        When making the story with over a hundred high resolution photos such as 2560x1920pixel, <BR>
                        some problems occur because of the performance of the machine.

                        behavior of machine-B becomes unstable though the machine-A is just no problem.

                        First a preview screen doesn't start any more easily. <BR>
                        Even if it starts, sound isn't synchronous with photos. <BR>
                        Even if I try to make a preview end, it doesn't end (^^;.

                    <p class="pb10">
                        The number of photos that PS3 is treatable is changed by the spec of the machine you use. <BR>
                        I think that trial and error is necessary to this.
