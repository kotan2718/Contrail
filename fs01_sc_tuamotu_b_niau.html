                6 years ago, Dr. Angela Kay Kepler taught me many things about Niau.
                I wanted to correct the explanation of Niau immediately,
                but various things came together and I was unable to do so.
                Recently, I was able to get in touch with Dr. Angela (she was still doing well and continuing her research.).
                So I decided to revise Niau's explanation, following advice from her.

                    <span class="back_gray fwb fss">Lagoon water is brackish.</span> <br>
                    This means it is less salty than sea water.
                    Some fresh water is diluting the salt water. <br>
                    This type of "lake" happens when you have an atoll that fills in with coral all around so there is has no connection to the ocean. <br>
                    When there is no rain, the interior "lake" gets hypersaline, i.e. very salty. <br>
                    However, I think <span class="back_burlywood fwb fss">Niau receives good rainfall,</span>
                    <span class="back_gray fwb fss">which adds fresh water to the central lagoon making it brackish. </span><br>
                    Eventually - in many thousands of years, this "lake" will be all fresh water and then it will disappear altogether.
                </p>
                <p class="pb10">
                    There is no need to think that there is an underground connection to the sea
                    because what we have here at Niau is unusual but a normal process of evolution,
                    whereby the atoll is filling in to become an island with no lagoon.  <br>
                    <span class="back_gray fwb fss">If there was a connection to the sea,
                    the lagoon would be subject to tidal flow and
                    it would probably not be brackish - it would be salty like the ocean.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="pb10">
                We have talked about this before.  <br>
                The phosphate comes from large numbers of seabirds
                - that are roosting and nesting in the trees - excreting (pooping!) lots and lots of guano,
                which is full of nitrogen. <br>
                It's a similar situation to Mataiva and Tehuata. <br>
                Tons of guano seep into the lagoon and much of it stays under the trees too, to enrich the soil.  <br>
                <span class="back_gray fwb fss">Phosphate is good for plants but not for coral growth. </span> <br>
                The reason the lagoon is green is because
                it is <span class="back_burlywood fwb fss">high in nitrogen</span> (from the seabird guano)
                and <span class="back_burlywood fwb fss">this encourages lots of green algae.</span>

            <p class="pb10">
                Niau is located 60 km west of Fakarava.
                Niau Atoll forms a complete ring and has a fully enclosed lagoon. <br>
                Originally , This lagoon was probably connected to the open sea. <br>
                However, due to the upheaval of the surrounding coral reefs, <br>
                there is currently no connection to the open sea, either above ground or underground.
            </p>
            <p class="pb10">
                The lagoon does not dry up and maintains its water level because the atoll receives moderate rainfall. <br>
                So far I have used the term lagoon, but I think it would be more natural to describe it as a lake.
            </p>
            <p class="pb10">
                With moderate rainfall, the island has accumulated groundwater and the lake has gradually turned brackish.<br>
                The phosphate and nitrogen provided by seabird guano and rainfall enrich the island's soil.<br>
                Niau also grows breadfruit and oranges.
                They cannot grow on other atolls in Tuamotu.
            </p>
            <p class="pb10">
                The abundance of water and vegetation has made the island home to the Niau Kingfisher,
                a species endemic to this island. <br>
                There is also information that fish resembling salmon live in the brackish water lagoon. <br>

            <p class="pb10">
                The water color of the lagoon is slightly greenish.<br>
                This is because the high concentration of nitrogen from guano produces lots of green algae.
