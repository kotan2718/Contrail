                As for the geographical feature data of
                the Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS),
                the "digital elevation data" is adopted after the FS2000. <BR>
                A certain area is divided into the mesh
                at constant intervals of 30m or 90m. <BR>
                Next, the pin which shows an average altitude
                to the center of each mesh is stood. <BR>
                It shows the geographical feature data of 3D like pins on a pincushion.
            </p>
            <p class="pb10">
                The drawing engine of the MSFS expresses
                the "geographical features data    of 3D"
                by putting the texture on the tip of each pin of this pincushion,
                and making it smoothly connect. <BR>
                The MSFS calls this geographical features data "terrain".
            </p>
            <p class="pb10">
                In FS2000, because it takes much time to drawing
                the geographical features in this method,
                it hardly became practical use. <BR>
                However, the method of drawing the "terrain" data
                has been greatly improved from FS2002. <BR>
                It came to be able to fly very comfortably
                on complex geographical features even when
                the "terrain" built based on super-detailed data
                of 30m mesh was used.
            </p>
            <p class="pb10">
                However, in spite of having carried such drawing engine,
                a 1km mesh terrain data is used in most areas of the MSFS. <BR>
                As for this, the same is said of FS2004. <BR>
                Of course, if a mesh is made fine,
                the amount of data will also increase exponentially. <BR>
                Therefore, I think that there is a limit in the quality of data. <BR>
                <BR>
                The MSFS opened "Terrain SDK (Software Development Kit)" to the public
                along with the adoption of "Terrain" data. <BR>
                If the data along SDK is made,
                "Terrain" data can be used with add-on scenery. <BR>
                The compiler tool for that was offered.
            </p>
            <p class="pb10">
                However, various formats exist in the digital elevation data. <BR>
                If the data that "Terrain SDK" directs is used,
                the terrain data can be made with a compiler tool. <BR>
                It is necessary to convert the digital elevation data offered by other formats
                into the format specified by the "Terrain SDK" to use the compiler tool.
            </p>
            <p class="pb20">
                In those days, as for the data specified by the "Terrain SDK",
                only the data of U.S.A. was being opened to the public.
            </p>
            <p class="pb10">
                Recently, the digital elevation data
                that the space shuttle had collected was open to the public. <BR>
                Now, this data is covering almost all the world. <BR>
                It is called SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) data. <BR>
                The 90m data (3arc/sec) and the 30m data (1arc/sec, the U.S.A. only) can be acquired
                as a freeware.
            </p>
            <p class="pb10">
                Since the SRTM data agrees in the format specified by the MSFS,
                it can create the "terrain" data directly. <BR>
                However, a fatal data-loss exists in the SRTM data. <BR>
                It is the datas in altitude 0 of the SRTM data. <BR>
                I will call this data loss the "missing data". <BR>
                I leave the discussion about the "missing data" to the specialists. <BR>
                In this page, the wonderful tool which interpolates this "missing data"
                and creates the "terrain" data is introduced.
            </p>
            <p class="pb10">
                The wonderful tool is SRTMtoBGL by Mr. Matthew Styles. <BR>
                This tool converts the SRTM data into the terrain data for the MSFS. <BR>
                The "missing data" is interpolated at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will experience a wonderful flight
                by witnessing the detailed geographical features.
