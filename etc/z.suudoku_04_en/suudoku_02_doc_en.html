                            Nikoli's website provides a video showing how to create puzzles.
                            According to the explanation, you first decide which cells to open,
                            then choose numbers to place so that a complete solution can be formed.

                            The key step in the above figure is ②.
                            You place numbers into the orange cells,
                            and as you proceed you fill in numbers in other cells that can be logically determined.
                            The video spends more than 30 minutes explaining this.
                            The explanation is clear, and after watching it I thought,
                            "I might be able to make puzzles this way."
                            I actually tried, but always failed near the end, when no more numbers could be placed.
                            Nikoli refers to this situation as being "stuck."

                            In this tool, the process starts by creating a completely filled grid.

                                I designed an algorithm to fill the entire grid using random numbers (The figure above step ①).

                                    If the puzzle becomes unsolvable at some point,
                                    the last blanks are undone, and other cells are blanked instead (feedback).

                                    The creation of the solution (a fully filled 9×9 set of cells)
                                    is based on random numbers.
                                    While checking the narrowing process for making blanks,
                                    I began to feel that some solutions are easier to narrow down than others.
                                    When the target is 26 and narrowing reaches 28,
                                    I thought that by continuing to use that solution, it should eventually yield 26.
                                    Since applying this logic, I have been able to generate puzzles with 23 and 24 open cells,
                                    so I don't think this reasoning is entirely wrong.

                            the longer it takes to solve.
                            In a sense, this can be considered an indicator of difficulty.

                            When generating puzzles, it's tempting to set the target number of opens as small as possible.
                            But the fewer opens, the harder it becomes to solve.
                            I recommend considering the "stat" line count and aiming for a manageable puzzle.

                            If the target number of opens is 25 or more, puzzles are usually generated fairly easily.
                            With 24, setting the trial count to 299 should usually succeed
                            before the limit is reached (though it's probability-based, so it may still fail).
                        </p>
                        <p class="fwm pb10">
                            The probrem is when the target is 23. With a limit of 299, puzzle generation often fails.
                            Even with 999 trials, it doesn't always succeed.
                            Trying multiple times with 299 is usually faster.
                            If it still fails, trying again after a few days may suddenly succeed.
                            This is because random numbers (pseudo-random, actually) are used in grid generation.
                            It is merely my own imagination,
                            but there may be times when random numbers that can reduce the open number continue,
                            or times when the opposite happens.

                        In case you create an interesting puzzle during the generating process
                        <p class="fwm pb10">
                            Since random numbers are used, you cannot directly control which cells are opened.
                            However, when the target number of opens is 24,
                            each time a puzzle with 26 opens is generated,
                            the positions of the opened cells displayed in “make” change.
                            If you come across an interesting puzzle, press [Ctrl]+[Break],
                            copy rows 6 through 32, and paste them into another sheet.
                            This way you can build your own collection of Sudoku puzzles.
