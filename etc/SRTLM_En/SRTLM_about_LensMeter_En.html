                    Regarding lenses, I think that magnification and focal length are not so uncomfortable for the general public.

                        <p class="pb10">
                            Magnification is a numerical representation of how near an object can be brought through a lens. 
                            If you can pull the target 100m ahead to 50m ahead, the angle of view will be doubled. 
                            Of course, just because it's through the lens doesn't mean that the object exists 50 meters ahead.
                            It feels as if it exists 50m ahead. <br>
                            Magnification also has vertical, horizontal, and angular magnification, but the magnification I just explained is called angular magnification. <br>
                            It is this angular magnification that is described as "optical 24x" on cameras.

                        <p class="pb10">
                            The focal length is determined by changing the distance to the paper by holding the lens over a piece of paper painted black and receiving sunlight.
                            It is the distance from the paper to the lens when smoke begins to rise from the paper (focus position, focal point). <br>

                    When dealing with the refractive power of eyeglasses lens, the focal length has a lot to do with it.
                    Just as there are some different types of magnification, there are some  different types of focal lengths.

                            This is common. But what is a "principal point" is a bit diffcult to explain. 
                            Depending on the shape of the lens, you may be able to visually confirm that this is the principal point.
                            Normally, it is often inside or outside the lens and cannot be visualized. <br>
                            If there is an opportunity, I would like to explain it, but this time I would like to omit it.

                        <p class="pb10">
                            This is called the back focal length (BFL), 
                            and the focal length in cameras also refers to the distance from the rearmost surface of the lens system to the film (now, usually  an image sensor). 
                            The unit of BFL is generally mm. 
                            Unlike the principal point, it has the advantage of being able to visualize the distance visually.

                    If the BFL can be measured, the refractive power is obtained.
                    Then, do you actually measure the distance from the back side of the lens to the focal point with a tape measure or the like while exposing the eyeglass lens to sunlight?

                            It's difficult, but if it's a 1D or 2D lens, it seems possible to measure it.
                            A 1D or 2D lenses are convex lens.
                            When we think of lenses, we tend to think of convex lenses.
                            There is also a lens with a concave shape.

                                On the other hand, Concave lenses are used to correct myopia. 
                                Both are equally popular lenses for eyeglasses.

                            Parallel rays are refracted by a convex lens and focus.
                            The BFL is the distance from the back of the lens to the focal point.

                            In the case of a concave lens, parallel rays diverge after being refracted by the lens. 
                            However, if we trace the widen rays backwards, we will find that they meet at one point. 
                            This is the focal point for concave lenses.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pb10">
                            If the distance from the back of the concave lens to the focal point is 1m, it will be 1D, just like the convex lens.
                            However, since it is not possible to distinguish between convex and concave lenses with this method, 
                            we modify it as follows.
                            The BFL of a convex lens is added a [+] sign.
                            The BFL of a concave lens is added a [-] sign.

                            1D and 2D of a convex lens are described as +1D and +2D hereafter.
                            Concave lenses are described as -1D, -2D, etc.

                            BFL can be measured with a tape measure for a convex lens, but not for a concave lens.
                            But unlike the focal length relative to the principal point, it doesn't need to be calculated.

                            The width of the ray bundle is narrow and difficult to see, but for various reasons it is not possible to widen the width any further.
                            I would like you to be patient with this.

                            In Figure 2-1, a lens with a power of 0D is set  in the lens meter.
                            The light beam emitted from the target (so-called light source) is acted by the first half of the collimator 
                            (the device that makes the light beam parallel: the two lenses on the front left in the figure) 
                            and becomes parallel light beams. 
                            In the second half of the collimator system (the lens with a power of 0D ), 
                            the rays are not refracted and enter the objective lenses as parallel rays.
                            Then, it is refracted by the two lenses (objective lens system) on the right back and focused on the focusing glass. 
                            The position of the target at this time is defined as the target reference position.

                    Unlike lenses used in cameras, 
                    eyeglass lenses have a unique structure that corrects the refractive error of the eye with a single lens.

                            Strangely enough, two points are in focus, and the image of the corona extends like a line instead of dots. 
                            It should be noted that the directions of the lines when each is in focus are orthogonal. 
                            The refracting power in the 0&deg; direction is 0D in both the upper and lower figures in Fig. 4, 
                            just because it is a cylinder.
                            (If you change the orientation of the lens in the upper figure and stack it on the lens in the lower figure, 
                            it will have the same shape as the 0 D lens in Figure 2-1).  You see?<br>
                            The 0&deg; direction coincides with the axis of the cylindrical lens. 
                            When a rays passes through a cylindrical lens, it is refracted in the 90&deg; direction, 
                            but not in the 0&deg; direction. 
                            In the upper part of Fig. 4, the linear direction of the corona image when it is in focus at +1.00 
                            (-1.00 in the lower part of Fig. 4) coincides with the axial direction of the cylindrical lens.
                            Therefore, from now on, when the corona image extends linearly, 
                            we will refer to the direction as the <strong>axial direction</strong>. 
                            <strong>"Ax"</strong> used in the notation of the lens represents the axial direction of the cylindrical lens. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="fwm pb10">
                            In Figure 4 (both upper and lower figures), when the corona image is in focus at 0.00, 
                            it will be in a blurred state extending linearly by 1.00D in the 90&deg; direction.
                            When the image is in focus at +1.00 in the upper part of Fig. 4 (-1.00 in the lower part), 
                            it will be blurred by 1.00D in the 180&deg; direction. 
                            This is the reason why the corona image is linear.

                                If you think about the shape of a cylindrical lens, 
                                you'll notice that it has max power in one direction and zero power in the orthogonal direction. 
                                If one direction is 0&deg;, the orthogonal direction is 90&deg;. <br>
                                One direction 0&deg; equals 180&deg; (similarly one direction 90&deg; equals  270&deg;). 
                                I won't go into detail here, but the refractive power of a cylindrical lens is 180&deg;cycles.
                                <br>
                                When the axial direction of eyeglass lenses is 0&deg;, it is customary to express it as 180&deg;. 
                                From now on, I will write 180&deg; when the <strong> axis direction is 0&deg;. </strong>

                            In Table 1, there are "myopia + astigmatism" and "hyperopia + astigmatism" in the refractive error of the eye.
                            In order to correct these refractive errors, it is necessary to superimpose two lenses, 
                            a spherical lens that corrects myopia and hyperopia, and a cylindrical lens that corrects astigmatism.
                            How does a eyeglass lens combine all this into a single lens?

                                    Let's tweak the shape of the cylindrical lens a little. 
                                    Look carefully at the cross-sectional shape of the lens in Fig. 6. 
                                    You can see that the front surface of the lens is curved compared to Fig. 4. 
                                    The back follows the curve of the front. 
                                    The back side of Fig. 4 has a cylindrical shape, 
                                    but the back side of Fig. 6 has a strong curve in one direction 
                                    and a weak curve in the direction perpendicular to it. <br>

                        <p class="fwm pb10">
                            Please note that the explanation after is based on my personal opinion. <br>
                            I wrote that there are three types of notations for spectacle lenses, but the lens meter can only measure using the [C C] display in ①. <br>
                            On the other hand, in eye refraction measurement (so-called optometry), astigmatism is corrected with a (-) cylindrical lens, and then hyperopia and myopia are corrected with a spherical lens. <br>
                            The correction value can be obtained with ② [SC(-)]. <br>
                            For this reason, conversion from ① to ② is absolutely necessary. <br>
                            However, it is unlikely that conversion from ① to ③ will be necessary. <br>
                            For refraction measurement, when measuring the useing glasses with a lens meter and setting them in the test frame, A spherical lens and a (-) cylindrical lens. <br>
                            If you can't get the data for your glasses, use an autorefractometer, a device that objectively measures the refractive power of your eyes, to get an estimate of the correction value.
                            Set it in the test frame and start measuring. The lens set in this case is also a spherical lens and a (-) cylindrical lens. <br>
                            Then why is there a notation of ③? I have heard that it is necessary when stocking lenses by power. <br>
                            Is it an old custom? <br>
                            What I am wondering about is the test lens that is set in the test frame when measuring refraction. <br>
                            It is called a test lens set, and it is a set of spherical lenses and cylindrical lenses. <br>
                            This set always contains a group of (+) cylindrical lenses. <br>
                            This is an unnecessary lens for refraction measurement. <br>
                            Astigmatism is usually measured using a (-) cylindrical lens.
                            In the case of the cross-cylinder method, it is possible to measure using a (+) cylindrical lens.
                            Is there anyone who is practicing it? <br>
                            In the case of the Kumokiri method, I cannot say that it is absolutely impossible, but it is certainly a very difficult method. 
                            For manufacturers who continue to sell lenses that are rarely used in sets, I would like to ask you about your intentions.
